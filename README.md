## Directory Structure

The `home-manager` and `system` directories contain `.nix` files for building my system. Note that `hardware-configuration.nix` is automatically generated by your system if using NixOS.

The actual dotfiles are located in `home-manager/dotfiles`, and are sym-linked to their desired locations through Home Manager (see the `home.file` attribute in `home.nix`).
