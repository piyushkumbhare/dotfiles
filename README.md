# Dotfiles

I'm pretty new to both Nix and the idea of dotfiles, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!

## Directory Structure

The `home-manager` and `system` directories contain `.nix` files for building my system. Note that `hardware-configuration.nix` is automatically generated by your system if using NixOS.

## Building

Both the system and home-manager configurations are built and managed through Nix Flakes.

To build, first clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:piyushkumbhare/dotfiles.git
```

### System

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ./dotfiles/system
```

### Home Manager

To build the home-manager configuration, first make sure you have [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-flakes-standalone) installed and enabled. Then it's as simple as running:
```
home-manager switch --flake ./dotfiles/home-manager
```
